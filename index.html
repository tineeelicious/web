         <h2>Lesson 1 - Emerging Technologies</h2>
         <p><b>EMERGING TECHNOLOGY</b> is a term generally used to describe a new technology, but it may also refer to the continuing development of existing technology; it can have slightly different meanings when used in
different areas, such as media, business, science, or education. The term commonly refers to technologies that are currently developing, or that are expected to be
available within the next five to ten years, and is usually reserved for technologies that are creating or are expected to create significant social or economic effects. Technological evolution is a theory of radical transformation of society through technological development.</p>
      
          <p><b>Evolution of Technologies: (Introduction to Industrial Revolution)</b></p>

          <p>The Industrial Revolution was a period of major industrialization and innovation that took place  during the late 1700s and early 1800s. An Industrial Revolution at its core occurs when a society shifts from using tools to make products to use new sources of energy, such as coal, to power machines in factories. The revolution started in England, with a series of innovations to make labor more efficient and productive. The Industrial Revolution was a time when the manufacturing of goods moved from small shops and homes to large factories. This shift brought about changes in culture as people moved from rural areas to big cities in order to work.</p>
      
          <p><b>Historical Background</b></p>

          <p>The industrial revolution began in Great Britain in the late 1770s before spreading to the rest of Europe. The first European countries to be industrialized after England were Belgium, France, and the German states. The final cause of the Industrial Revolution was the effects created by the Agricultural Revolution. As previously stated, the Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the 18th century due in part to an increase in food production, which was the key outcome of the Agricultural Revolution. The four types of industries are:
            <ul>
              <li>• The <b>primary industry</b> involves getting raw materials e.g. mining, farming, and fishing. </li>
              <li>• The <b>secondary industry</b> involves manufacturing e.g. making cars and steel. </li>
              <li>• The <b>tertiary industries</b> provide a service e.g. teaching and nursing. </li>
              <li>• The <b>quaternary industry</b> involves research and development industries e.g. IT. </li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Lesson 2 - Technology and Ethics</h3>
        <p><b>TECHNOLOGY AND ETHICS</b></p>
        <p>The Internet boom has provided many benefits for society, allowing the creation of new tools and
          new ways for people to interact. As with many technological advances, however, the Internet has not been
          without negative aspects. For example, it has created new concerns about privacy, and it has been hampered
          by spam and viruses. Moreover, even as it serves as a medium for communication across the globe, it
          threatens to cut off people who lack access to it.
          <b>Ethics</b> is particularly important for the accountancy profession, with a code for professional ethics
          based on five basic principles: <b>integrity,</b> <b>competence,</b> <b>and due care,</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> <b>and
          professional behavior</b>. However, the emergence of new technologies raises some new challenges for the
          profession to address.
          The increasing use of big data, algorithmic decision-making, and artificial intelligence can enable
          more consistent, evidence-based and accurate judgments or decisions, often more quickly and efficiently.
          However, these strengths can potentially have a darker side too, throwing up questions around the ethical
          use of these fairly new technologies.</p>ical principles
        <p><b>GENERAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>1. Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders
                  in computing.</li>
                <li>2. Avoid harm.</li>
                <li>3. Be honest and trustworthy.</li>
                <li>4. Be fair and take action not to discriminate</li>
                <li>5. Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing</li>
                  artifacts.</li>
                <li>6. Respect privacy.</li>
                <li>7. Honor confidentiality</li>
              </ul>

        <p><b>PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES</b></p>
        <ul>
        <li>1. Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.</li>
        <li>2. Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice.</li>
        <li>3. Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work.</li>
        <li>4. Accept and provide appropriate professional review.</li>
        <li>5. Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including
analysis of possible risks.</li>
        <li>6. Perform work only in areas of competence.</li>
        <li>7. Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their
consequences.</li>
        <li>8. Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by
the public good.</li>
        <li> 9. Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure</li>.
        </ul>

        <p><b>PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES</b></p>
        <ul>
           <li>1. Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.</li>
           <li>2. Articulate, encourage acceptance of and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by
            members of the organization or group.</li>
           <li>3. Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life.</li>
           <li>4. Articulate, apply, and support policies and processes that reflect the principles of the Code.</li>
           <li>5. Create opportunities for members of the organization or group to grow as professionals.</li>
           <li>6. Use care when modifying or retiring systems. Interface changes, the removal of features, and
            even software updates have an impact on the productivity of users and the quality of their work.</li>
           <li>7. Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of
            society.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>DIGITAL PRIVACY</b></p>
        <p><b>Digital Privacy</b> is the protection of personally identifiable or business identifiable information that
          is collected from respondents through information collection activities or from other sources. It is a
          collective definition that encompasses three sub-related categories; information privacy, communication
          privacy, and individual privacy It is often used in contexts that promote advocacy on behalf of individual
          and consumer privacy rights in digital spheres, and is typically used in opposition to the business practices
          of many e-marketers/businesses/companies to collect and use such information and data.</p>
        <p><b>INFORMATION PRIVACY</b></p>
        <p>In the context of digital privacy, <b>information privacy</b> is the notion that individuals should have the
          freedom, or right, to determine how their digital information, mainly that pertaining to personally
          identifiable information, is collected and used. Every country has various laws that dictate how information
          may be collected and used by companies. Some of those laws are written to give agency to the preferences
          of individuals/consumers in how their data is used. In other places, like in the United States, privacy law is
          argued by some to be less developed in this regard, For example, some legislation, or lack of, allows
          companies to self-regulate their collection and dissemination practices of consumer information.</p>

        <p><b>COMMUNICATION PRIVACY</b></p>
        <p>In the context of digital privacy, <b>communication privacy</b> is the notion that individuals should have
          the freedom, or right, to communicate information digitally with the expectation that their communications
          are secure; meaning that messages and communications will only be accessible to the sender's original
          intended recipient. However, communications can be intercepted or delivered to other recipients without
          the sender's knowledge, in a multitude of ways.</p>
        <p>Communications can be intercepted directly through various hacking methods; this is expanded
          upon further below. Communications can also be delivered to recipients unbeknownst to the sender due to
          false assumptions made regarding the platform or medium which was used to send information. An example
          of this is a failure to read a company's privacy policy regarding communications on their platform could
          lead one to assume their communication is protected when it is in fact not. Additionally, companies
          frequently have been known to lack transparency in how they use information, this can be both intentional
          and unintentional. Discussion of communication privacy necessarily requires consideration of
          technological methods of protecting information/communication in digital mediums, the effectiveness, and
          ineffectiveness of such methods/systems, and the development/advancement of new and current
          technologies.</p>

        <p><b>INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY</b></p>
        <p>In the context of digital privacy, individual privacy is the notion that individuals have a right to
           exist freely on the internet, in that they can choose what types of information they are exposed to, and more
           importantly that unwanted information should not interrupt them An example of a digital breach of
           individual privacy would be an internet user receiving unwanted ads and emails/spam, or a computer virus
           that forces the user to take actions they otherwise wouldn't. In such cases the individual, during that
           moment, doesn't exist digitally without interruption from unwanted information; thus, their individual
           privacy has been infringed upon.</p>

        <p><b>TREATS AND CHALLENGES</b></p>
        <p>With Technology moving at a fast pace it is always been a challenge for Security. As security
          professionals, we need to keep pace with ever-changing technology and be aware of the AI, IoT, Big Data,
          Machine Learning, etc. It is no more Guards, guns & gates it is more than that & we need to play a major
          role for a security professional to support business or rather we should be able to understand the language
          of business and talk to the leaders in their language. With Growing needs Cyber & Data Security is getting
          prominence that requires security practitioners to focus on the business need for securing data,
          understanding security and risk from a business perspective by extensively interacting with the business
          community in understanding their requirements or what they want.</p>

        <h4>Lesson 3 - Artificial Intelligence</h4>

        <p><b>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</b></p>
        <p>What is Artificial Intelligence?</p>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence.
          Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", or “the ability to learn
          and solve problems” hence Artificial Intelligence means "a man-made thinking power."
          So, we can define Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the branch of computer science by which we can
          create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions.
          Intelligence, as we know, is the ability to acquire and apply knowledge. Knowledge is the
          information acquired through experience. Experience is the knowledge gained through exposure (training).
          Summing the terms up, we get artificial intelligence as the “copy of something natural (i.e., human
          beings)‘WHO’ is capable of acquiring and applying the information it has gained
          through exposure.”
          Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human-based skills such as learning,
          reasoning, and solving problems with Artificial Intelligence you do not need to preprogram a machine to
          do some work, despite that you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can work with
          own intelligence.</p>
        <p>Intelligence is composed of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>*Reasoning</li>
          <li>*Learning</li>
          <li>*Problem Solving</li>
          <li>*Perception</li>
          <li>*Linguistic Intelligence</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Goals of Artificial Intelligence:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>1. Replicate human intelligence</li>
        <li>2. Solve Knowledge-intensive tasks</li>
        <li>3. An intelligent connection of perception and action</li>
        <li>4. Building a machine which can perform tasks that requires human intelligence such as:</li>
            <ul>
               <li>✓ Proving a theorem</li>
               <li>✓ Playing chess</li>
               <li>✓ Plan some surgical operation</li>
               <li>✓ Driving a car in traffic</li>
            </ul>
        <li>5. Creating some system which can exhibit intelligent behavior, learn new things by itself,
demonstrate, explain, and can advise to its user.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>ADVANTAGES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIEGENCE:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>*High Accuracy with fewer errors</li>
          <li>*High-Speed<li>
          <li>*High-Reliabiity</li>
          <li>*Useful for risky areas</li>
          <li>*Digital Assistant</li>
          <li>*Useful as a public utility</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>DISADVANTAGES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIEGENCE:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>*Can't think out of the box</li>
          <li>*High Cost<li>
          <li>*No feelings and emotions</li>
          <li>*No Original Creativity</li>

        <h5>Lesson 4 - Internet of Things </h5>

        <p><b>INTERNET OF THINGS</b></p>
        <p>Generally, The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects or "things" embedded
          with electronics, software, sensors, and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect and
          exchange data. IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects,
          animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network
          without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. IoT is a network of devices that can
          sense, accumulate and transfer data over the internet without any human intervention.
          Simply stated, the Internet of Things consists of any device with an on/off switch connected to the
          Internet. This includes almost anything you can think of, ranging from cellphones to building maintenance
          to the jet engine of an airplane. Medical devices, such as a heart monitor implant or a biochip transponder
          in a farm animal, can transfer data over a network and are members of the IoT. If it has an off/on the switch,
          then it can, theoretically, be part of the system. The IoT consists of a gigantic network of internet-connected
          “things” and devices. Ring, a doorbell that links to your smartphone, provides an excellent example of a
          recent addition to the Internet of Things.</p>

        <p><b>HISTORY OF IOT</b></p>
        <p>The Internet of Things has not been around for very long. However, there have been visions of
          machines communicating with one another since the early 1800s. Machines have been providing direct
          communications since the telegraph (the first landline) was developed in the 1830s and 1840s. Described
          as “wireless telegraphy,” the first radio voice transmission took place on June 3, 1900, providing another
          necessary component for developing the Internet of Things. The development of computers began in the
          1950s.</p>
          <p>The Internet, itself a significant component of the IoT, started out as part of DARPA (Defense
          Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 1962 and evolved into ARPANET in 1969. In the 1980s,
          commercial service providers began supporting public use of ARPANET, allowing it to evolve into our
          modern Internet. Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) became a reality in early 1993, with the Department
          of Defense providing a stable, highly functional system of 24 satellites. This was quickly followed by
          privately owned, commercial satellites being placed in orbit. Satellites and landlines provide basic
          communications for much of the IoT. One additional and important component in developing a functional
          IoT was IPV6’s remarkably intelligent decision to increase address space.</p>
          <p>The Internet of Things, as a concept, wasn’t officially named until 1999. One of the first examples
          of an Internet of Things is from the early 1980s and was a Coca Cola machine, located at the Carnegie
          Melon University. Local programmers would connect by the Internet to the refrigerated appliance, and
          check to see if there was a drink available and if it was cold, before making the trip.
          By the year 2013, the Internet of Things had evolved into a system using multiple technologies,
          ranging from the Internet to wireless communication and from micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)
          to embedded systems. The traditional fields of automation (including the automation of buildings and
          homes), wireless sensor networks, GPS, control systems, and others, all support the IoT.</p>
          <p>Kevin Ashton, the Executive Director of Auto-ID Labs at MIT, was the first to describe the Internet
          of Things, during his 1999 speech. Kevin Ashton stated that Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) was a
          prerequisite for the Internet of Things. He concluded if all devices were “tagged,” computers could manage,
          track, and inventory them. To some extent, th• Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s difficult for devices from
          different manufacturers to communicate with each other.e tagging of things has been achieved through technologies
          such as digital watermarking, barcodes, and QR codes.</p>
          <p>Inventory Control is one of the more obvious advantages of the Internet of Things.</p>

          <p><b>IOT ADVANTAGES:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>• Improved Customer Engagement</li>
            <li>• Technology Optimization</li>
            <li>• Reduced Waste</li>
            <li>• Enhanced Data Collection</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>IOT DISADVANTAGES:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>• As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices,
              the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.</li>
            <li>• If there’s a bug in the system, it’s likely that every connected device will become corrupted.</li>
            <li>• Since there’s no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it’s difficult for devices from
                different manufacturers to communicate with each other.</li>
            <li>• Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers maybe even millions of IoT
              devices and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>IOT CHALLENGES:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>• Security</li>
            <li>• Privacy</li>
            <li>• Complexity</li>

        <h6>Lesson 5 - Augmented Reality </h6>

        <p><b>AUGMENTED REALITY</b></p>
        <p>Augmented reality is an interactive experience that enhances the real world with computer-generated perceptual information. Using software, apps, and hardware such as AR glasses, augmented reality overlays digital content onto real-life environments and objects.
          This enriches the user experience and turns one’s immediate surroundings into an interactive learning environment which is particularly valuable in manufacturing and Industry 4.0 processes.
          It allows industrial users to become “one” with the systems and machines they work with, and to optimize and augment technology and IoT networks with human ingenuity, observation, and creativity.</p>
        <p><b>VIRTUAL REALITY</b></p>
        <p>VR is fully immersive, which tricks your senses into thinking you’re in a different environment or world apart from the
          real world. Using a head-mounted display (HMD) or headset, you’ll experience a computer-generated world of imagery
          and sounds in which you can manipulate objects and move around using haptic controllers while tethered to a console
          or PC. It is also called a computer-simulated reality. It refers to computer technologies using reality headsets to generate
          realistic sounds, images and other sensations that replicate a real environment or create an imaginary world. Advanced
          VR environment will engage all five senses (taste, sight, smell, touch, sound), but it is important to say that this is not
          always possible.</p>
        <p><b>MIXED REALITY</b></p>
        <p>Mixed Reality (MR), sometimes referred to as hybrid reality, is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce
          new environments and visualizations where physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real-time. It means
          placing new imagery within a real space in such a way that the
          new imagery is able to interact, to an extent, with what is real in the physical world we know
          For example, with MR, you can play a virtual video game, grab your real-world water bottle, and smack an
          imaginary character from the game with the bottle. Imagination and reality have never been so intermingled.
          The key characteristic of MR is that the synthetic content and the real-world content are able to react to each other in
          real-time.</p>

              <h7>Lesson 6 - Data Science </h7>

              <p><b>DATA SCIENCE</b></p>
              <p><b>Data science</b> is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from
          structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. Data science is much more than simply analyzing data. It offers a range of roles and requires a range of skills.</p>
              <p><b>What are Data Information?</b></p>
              <p><b>Data</b> can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner, which should be suitable for
                    communication, interpretation, or processing, by human or electronic machines. It can be described as unprocessed facts and figures. It is
                    represented with the help of characters such as alphabets (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9) or special characters <b>(+, -, /, *, <,>, =, etc.)</b>.</p>
              <p><b>Information</b> is the processed data on which decisions and actions are based. It is data that has been processed into a form that is meaningful to
                    the recipient and is of real or perceived value in the current or the prospective action or decision of recipient.</p>

              <p><b>DATA PROCESSING CYCLE:</b></p>
                 <ul>
                <li><b>Input</b>- in this step, the input data is prepared in some convenient form for processing. The form will depend on the processing machine.</li>
                <li><b>Processing</b>- in this step, the input data is changed to produce data in a more useful form.</li>
                <li><b>Output</b>- at this stage, the result of the proceeding processing step is collected. The particular form of the output data depends on the use of the data.</li>
                 </ul>

              <p><b>DATA TYPES FROM DATA ANALYTICS PERSPECTIVE:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><b>1.STRUCTURED DATA</b>- is data that adheres to a per-defined data model and is therefore straightforward to analyze.
                         Structured data conforms to a tabular format with a relationship between the different rows and columns.</li>
                  <li><b>2.UNSTRUCTURED DATA</b>- is information that either does not have a predefined data model or is not organized in a pre-defined manner.
                         Unstructured information is typically text-heavy but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well.
                         This results in irregularities and ambiguities that make it difficult to understand using traditional programs as
                         compared to data stored in structured databases.</li>
                  <li><b>3.SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA</b>- is a form of structured data that does not conform with the formal structure of data models associated with
                         relational databases or other forms of data tables, but nonetheless, contains tags or other markers to separate
                         semantic elements and enforce hierarchies of records and fields within the data. </li>
                  <li><b>4.METADATA-DATA ABOUT DATA</b>- The last category of data type is metadata. From a technical point of view, this is not a separate data
                         structure, but it is one of the most important elements for Big Data analysis and big data solutions. Metadata
                         is data about data. It provides additional information about a specific set of data.</li>
                        </ul>

               <p><b>WHAT IS BIG DATA?</b></p>
               <p><b>BIG DATA</b> is the term for the collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools
                     or traditional data processing applications. Big Data is characterized by 3V and more:</p>
                     <ul>
                      <li>1.VOLUME</li>
                      <li>2.VELOCITY</li>
                      <li>3.VARIETY</li>
                      <li>4.VERACITY</li>

             <p><b>OTHER EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES</b></p> 
             <p><b>NANOTECHNOLOGY</b></p>
             <p><b>Nanotechnology</b> is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometers. Nanoscience and
                nanotechnology are the study and application of extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry, biology,
                physics, materials science, and engineering</p>

             <p><b>APPLICATIONS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>1. Medicine</li>
                  <li>2. Electronics</li>
                  <li>3. Food</li>
                  <li>4. Agriculture</li>
                  <li>5. Vehicle Manufacturer</li>
                </ul>


             <p><b>BIOTECHNOLOGY</b></p>
             <p><b>Biotechnology</b> is technology based on biology - biotechnology harnesses cellular and biomolecular processes to develop
                technologies and products that help improve our lives and the health of our planet. We have used the biological processes of
                microorganisms for more than 6,000 years to make useful food products, such as bread and cheese, and to preserve dairy products.</p>
            
             <p><b>APPLICATIONS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>1. Agriculture (Green Biotechnology)</li>
                  <li>2. Aquaculture Fisheries</li>
                  <li>3. Medicine (Medicinal Biotechnology)</li>
                  <li>4. Environmental (Environmental Biotechnology)</li>
                </ul>

             <p>Today, biotechnology covers many different disciplines (e.g.genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, etc.). New technologies
                and products are developed every year within the areas of e.g. Medicine (development of new medicines and therapies), agriculture
                (development of genetically modified plants, biofuels, biological treatment) or industrial biotechnology (production of chemicals, paper, textiles, and food).</p>
           

             <p><b>BLOCK CHAIN TECHNOLOGY</b></p>
             <p>Originally blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a
                cryptography hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).
                A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of
                computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using
                cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).</p>

             <p><b>In order for a block to be added to the blockchain, four thingd must happen:</b></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>1. A transaction must occur.</li>
                  <li>2. That transaction must verified.</li>
                  <li>3. That transaction must be stored in a block.</li>
                  <li>4.That block must be given a hash.</li>
                </ul>

             <p><b>HISTORY</b></p>
                <ul>
                 <li>1. The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. They wanted to implement a
                     system where document timestamps could not be tampered with.</li>
                 <li>2. In 1992, Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be
                     collected into one block.</li>
                 <li>3. The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an
                      important way using the Hash cash like the method to add blocks to the chain without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party.</li>
                 <li>4. In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (Gigabyte). In
                     January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size.</li>
                 <li>5. The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.</li>

              <h8>Lesson 8 -EMBEDDED SYSTEM, ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING AND CYBERSECURITY </h8>

              <p><b>EMBEDDED SYSTEM</b></p> 
              <p>It is a controller with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints.
                 It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts.
                 Embedded systems control many devices in common use today.
                 Ninety-eight percent of all microprocessor manufactured are used in embedded systems.
                 Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. microprocessors with integrated memory and peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for
                 memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types
                 ranging from general-purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand.</p>

              <p><b>ADVANTAGES:</b></p>
                 <ul>
                  <li>1. Easily Customizable</li>
                  <li>2. Low power consumption</li>
                  <li>3. Low cost</li>
                  <li>4. Enhanced performance</li>
                 </ul>
              <p><b>ADVANTAGES:</b></p>
                 <ul>
                  <li>1. High development effort</li>
                  <li>2. Larger time to market</li>
                 </ul>
              <p><b>BASIC STRUCTURE OF AN EMBEDDED SYSTEM:</b></p>

                 </ul>

              <p><b>ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING</b></p>
              <p>The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM)
               - “Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, uses computer-aided design to build objects layer by layer.”</p>

              <p><b>CYBERSECURITY</b></p>
              <p>It is the protection of computer systems from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or
                 misdirection of the services they provide.</p>
          
              <p>Due to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, cybersecurity is also one of the major challenges in the contemporary world. Cybersecurity is
                 often confused with information security but it focuses on protecting computer systems from unauthorized access or being otherwise damaged or made inaccessible.</p>

              <p>Information security is a broader category that looks to protect all information assets, whether in hard copy or in digital form. The term cybercrime is used to
                 describe an unlawful activity in which computer or computing devices such as smartphones, tablets.
                 Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), etc. which are standalone or a part of a network are used as a tool or/and target of criminal activity. It is often committed
                 by the people of destructive and criminal mindset either for revenge, greed or adventure.</p>

                 <p><b>BENEFITS OF CYBERSECURITY:</b></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>1. Business protection against malware, ransomware, phishing, and social engineering.</li>
                      <li>2. Protection for data and networks</li>
